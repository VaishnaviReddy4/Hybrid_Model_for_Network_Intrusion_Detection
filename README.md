### A Prophetic Hybrid Model to predict Intrusions using Network Data Traffic Analysis.

The problem statement initially is to monitor network availability and activity to identify anomalies (Network Traffic Analysis) and to detect the unknown malware attacks over the network (Intrusion Detection) using the NSL KDD benchmark dataset.
In Network Traffic Classification, different classifiers are used to classify and analyze the traffic. Understanding how networks work and monitoring the performance of networks and how to effectively control and manage network are the key roles.
In Network Intrusion Detection System, intrusions are detected using statistical analysis, to extract strongly correlated features. An Auto Encoder (Deep Learning Technique) is used on the pre-processed dataset, to further perform the feature selection, and then we train a model using a fully connected deep neural network. Then we use this trained model on a test dataset and capture its accuracy.
